# MOEA Framework

The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and experimenting with multiobjective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms.  The MOEA Framework
supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, genetic programming, grammatical
evolution, and more.  A number of algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, U-NSGA-III,
Îµ-MOEA, GDE3, PAES, PESA2, SPEA2, IBEA, SMS-EMOA, SMPSO, OMOPSO, CMA-ES, AGE-MOEA-II, and MOEA/D.  In addition, the
MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization
algorithms.
